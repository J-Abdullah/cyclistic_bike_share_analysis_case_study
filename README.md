## Project Description

Cyclistic aims to maximize the number of annual memberships by understanding usage patterns of casual riders versus annual members. This project involves analyzing historical bike trip data to identify trends and differences in bike usage. Key questions addressed include:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on historical bike trip data provided by Cyclistic. The dataset includes:

- **Trip Start Time**: Timestamp of when the bike ride started.
- **Trip End Time**: Timestamp of when the bike ride ended.
- **Duration**: Total duration of the ride in seconds.
- **User Type**: Indicates whether the rider is a casual rider or an annual member.
